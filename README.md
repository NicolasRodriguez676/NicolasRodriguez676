Welcome to Nicolas Rodriguez's Github!

For now, you can take a look at the files I made for a 65C02 computer. I am currently working on an ATTiny84a microcontroller to eventually produce basic sound.
The Tiny AVR will also accept commands, serially, from my computer GUI that I have yet to start working on. Check back every few weeks to keep track of the progress being made!
